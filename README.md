<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Web Scraping Task
Choose and e-commerce website and store the product details into a database. 

### Linear Regression Task
Predict `z` from `x` and `y`.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Install the necessary packages in your own environment.
```
jupyter notebooks, Python 3.6, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Tensorflow, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, selenium
```

Note that Task 2 is done in Google Colaboratory.

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```git clone https://github.com/FairozaAmira/pulsifi-data-assignments.git
```
2. Download the data from [here](https://github.com/FairozaAmira/pulsifi-data-assignments/blob/master/test.csv) for Task 2.
4. Run all notebooks. Task 2 is done in Google Colaboratory. The data should be put insided the Google Drive folder, preferable same folder with the notebooks and the drive should be mounted first.

## Task 1: Web Scraping

1. Download the chrome driver
2. Get the url of the e-commerce website
3. Inspect the class (code scripts) of the needed products, where it is store and and what is their product's name and price.

Ongoing task:
* Append the database by searching more products with the same name in other websites.

## Task 2: Linear Regression

1. Predict `z` from `x` and `y`.
2. Exploratory data analysis for the data.
3. Split the data into train and test dataset.
4. Train in machine learning algorithms such as the SVM regressor and in MLP.
5. Scale the data to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE).
6. Compare and discuss the results.
